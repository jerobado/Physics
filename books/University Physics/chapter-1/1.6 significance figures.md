**Accuracy** - is how close a measurement is to the accepted value for that measurement

**Precision** - refers to how close the agreement is between repeated independent measurements (which are repeated under the same conditions)

**Uncertainty** - is a quantitative measure of how much your measured values deviate from one another.

**Discrepancy** - or "measurement error" is the difference between the measured value and a given standard or expected value.
