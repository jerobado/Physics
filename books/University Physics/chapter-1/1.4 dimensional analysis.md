**Dimension**
- a measurement of length in one direction.
- any physical measurement such as length, time, mass, etc.

i.e.
- a line has one dimension (1D)
- a square has two dimensions (2D)
- and a cube has three dimensions (3D)

**Dimensionless quantity** - or more precisely, a _quantity with the dimension of 1_ is a quantity without any physical units and thus a pure number.

**Pure numbers** - are dimensionless quantities, for example 1, i, π, e, and φ. Units of number such as the dozen, gross, googol, and Avogadro's number may also be considered dimensionless.

Any mathematical equation relating physical quantities must be <ins>**dimentionally consistent**</ins>, which means the equation must ober the following rules:
- every term in an expression must have the same dimensions
- arguments of any mathematical functions such as sine, cosine, logarithims or pure numbers in the equation must be dimensionless

If either of these rules is violated, an equation is not dimensionally consistent and cannot possibly be a correct statement of physical law.
